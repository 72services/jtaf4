## Background
The Turnverein Erlach http://www.tverlach.ch is organizing competitions for children and youth for years.

First these events were accomplished by hand, starting from 1997 with Excel and starting from 1999 with an Access solution.
In 2005 JTAF was created in Java using the Eclipse rich client platform and was made open source.

Over the following years JTAF was reengineered as a web application currently using Spring Boot in the backend and Angular in the frontend. 

## Start using it, now!
JTAF is available as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) in the cloud! https://www.jtaf.ch/
