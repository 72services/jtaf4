## Background
The [Turnverein Erlach](https://tverlach.ch) is organizing competitions for children and youth for many years.

First the results have been calculated manually. Starting from 1997 with Excel and from 1999 with an Access solution.<br>
In 2005 JTAF was implemented with Java using the Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform) and made open source.

Over the following years JTAF was reimplemeted as a web application and completly renewed  using [Vaadin](https://www.vaadin.com), 
[jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
